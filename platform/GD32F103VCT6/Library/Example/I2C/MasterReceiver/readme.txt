  @brief
    This demo is based on the GD32107C-EVAL board, it shows the I2C programming 
  mode in master receiving mode. In this demo,I2C1 is operated as master receiver,
  and the SCL line and SDA line of I2C1 interface are controled by the I/O pin 
  PB6 and PB7 respectively.
    This demo shows the receiving data process of the master.And it will store 
  the received data in the I2C1_Buf_Read array.

  @note
    This demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no 
  specific slave.In the specific application,we must send the correct slave 
  address, and the master and the slave may need to be connected by the jumper 
  if necessary.
